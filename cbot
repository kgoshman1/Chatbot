    <template>Wise choice!  Let's take a deep dive into the world of the 
    creative world of the front end engineer!  The front-end engineer has the
    primary responsibility of the "face" of the application.  They focus on 
    giving the user a working, functional, and pleasant experience, while 
    keeping the details abstracted away.  Their primary tools will include 
    languages such as html, css, and Javascript, as well as a whole host of 
    other technologies.  But beware, the life of a front-end engineer can be
    tiresome, as the technologies are rapidly changing.  If you would like to 
    learn more, press "frontend", else "exit" to return to the previous menu.

    <template>Great! let's take a closer look into why you may or may not want
    to head down this career path.  First and foremost, one of the primary 
    advantages of this path are that when applying for jobs, you will have one
    of the widest selections, as they all require some permutation of the "stack"
    mentioned previously.  It should be noted that beyond the fatigue one may
    experience from keeping up with technologies, you may also be competing with
    many of the "bootcamp" graduates who focus primarily on frontend technologies.

    <template>WHOOSH, WIZZ, POP, BANG!  So you think you've got what it takes to 
    make a story come to life through code?  Let's dig a little further to find
    out if its really for you.  Beyond the obvious pro's of working on your 
    favorite childhood (and maybe adult) dreams, video game designers get to flex
    their imaginitive sides to push the limits of modern gaming and computing. 
    Some not so obvious downside that you should be aware of, many engineers are
    forced to work long hours to make tight deadlines on stretched budgets.
    Similarly they can be fired at the end of a game cycle, or even worse, should
    the game have major flaws and poor review they will be let go for that (cough
    cough, looking at you cyberpunk).  The choice is yours, risk included.  Please

    algorithms?  You think you are able to work in the abstract and the theoretical?
    Well if you happen to have aced all your math classes, it may just be for you.
    As alluded to many times, this field solves complex problems, using statistics
    and complex algorithms.  Beyond getting to brag to your friends that you
    are working in the newest and hottest field, you should also know that you
    will be handsomely rewarded for your efforts, considering these professionals
    are some of the highest paid in the software industry.  Hold your horses there!
    Before you get too excited, you should know that many of these positions require
    higher levels of education and experience. . . aka PHD.  Similarly, while
    the media may make these positions sound like a slice of heaven on earth, the 
    job does require working on long projects that may not work out as soon as you
    hoped.  After your are finished please press "exit" to return to the menu.

    <template>Fascinated by bitcoin?  Love finance?  Just want to turn over
    the traditional banking system?  Your in luck!  The new field of block-
    chain engineering is still in its infancy and rapidly gaining speed.  Thousands
    of engineers will be needed to write "smart-contracts" and develop the "blockchain"
    using new technologies such as etherium as well as the old such as C++.
    Beyond this more and more cryptocurrencies are being developed as the world
    looks to replace the traditional forms of currency.  Sounds interesting?

    <template>So apparently the thought of staking your career on an unproven 
    technology hasn't scared you off yet.  Well, the good news for you is that 
    blockchain engineer are one of the highest paid software engineers in the 
    market today.  Not only does the role command some of the highest salaries,
    but their is such demand that finding a job will not likely be very hard.
    As more and more big finance, tech, and banks try to develop their own 
    solutions, the market will only continue to explode.  As everything in life,
    this field does not shy away from its share of risk.  While blockchain is 
    likely to succeed, there are many who belive it may not see the future success
    which many are hoping for.  While the underlying blockchain technology is 
    still highly valuable, it could reduce demand for engineers of this skillset 
    in the future.  Please press "exit" to return to the menu when finished.

    <template>Always dreamed of being a "hacker"?  The thought of using your
    powers for good or evil excites you?  Well the role of a cyber security 
    engineer just may the perfect fit.  These engineers are primarily concerned
    with finding security to solutions to protect the data of both people and
    businesses.  There are a multitude of roles within the field of cyber security,
    each with its own pros and cons.  You will need to master many technologies,
    but will need a fundamental understanding of languages such as C and sql in 
    order to prevent attacks at the lowest levels.  If fighting virtual bad 
    guys sounds like living in a movie to you, please enter "cyberfighter"

    <pattern>cyberfighter</pattern>
    <template>So you've decided to use your new found powers for good?  Well you
    should know that you have chosen wisely, as the demand for cybersecurity 
    professionals is rising rapidly as more and more businesses are shifting 
    online.  As these companies and people begin storing more and more of their
    precious data, so too will the criminals follow.  This necessitates a curious
    mind, and someone who must be willing to "think like the bad guy".  These 
    engineers are responsible for shielding business from lawsuits and people 
    from exposing their most private information.  Even a single security leak
    could cost hundreds of milliions in lawsuits and damages.  But with great
    responsibility so do does the power and reward.  You will take part in 
    being a behind the scenes superhero, like batman with a keyboard.  And while
    nobody may no that you protected them from the bad guy, you can sleep sound
    knowing your as close to your friendly neighborhood spiderman as you can be.
    When finished reading (and daydreaming of fighting bad guys) press "exit".
